	<p> Pray this prayer of Repentance & Salvation, and ask Christ Jesus to come into your life and Save you from Sin and the Wrath of God.

Father God, in the name of Jesus, Thank you for your Son Jesus Christ who died on The cross because of my sins and the sins of this world. I believe that Jesus Christ came to earth, The Holy God in the form of a man, lived, was crucified, hung on a cross, died and was buried, rose up on the 3rd day and that same Jesus Christ was God in  the flesh. I believe that Jesus Christ did all this for ME, and I accept Jesus Christ as MY Lord and Savior.<span style="font-size:1.5em;"> &lt;p&gt </span>I am confessing with MY own mouth and I do believe in MY own heart that He truly is God. I confess MY sins to you and you alone and I am asking for forgiveness.
